#CoalFinalProject

I would like to extend a special thank you Muhammad Ali Khan for his contributions to this project.
Ali created an intuitive menu system and fixed errors in the assembly code.
Without his hard work and dedication, this project would not have been possible.
Thank you for your valuable contribution.
